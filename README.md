Anemia Analysis WebApp
Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for analyzing anemia-related data and assisting users through the process. The key features include:

AMuIti-Image Analysis: Integrates three different image types (nail, palm, and eye) to enable more accurate multi-modal analysis.
Advanced CNN Architecture: Employs Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet_Bases) for deep learning capabilities.
AI-Powered Chatbot: Leverages IBM Watson Assistant to guide users through the entire process as a personalized medical assistant.
RAG Application Feature: Allows users to ask anemia-related questions in natural language and retrieve precise, contextual information.
